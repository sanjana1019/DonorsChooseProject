Donor's Choose Project - for Public School Funding 


Project Description: 

Donor's Choose is a platform that connect people with teachers from public schools who are requesting extra funding for various school related needs or projects (such as funding for class trips, science projects, or basic necessities such as socks/clothing at low income public schools). Teachers at 81% if public schools in America have posted a project on this site and they have raised more than $812 million dollars in classroom project funding. Users can search for projects to fund using several criteria such as subject, teachers, school, city/state, age group, project type, and amount needed. I chose to do my project on this topic because the platform has immense social impact on public schools and improving the quality of education and experience for students who go to schools that may lack funding. 

My goal was to see this program from the point of view of a user who is trying to make a donation and needs help determining which project he/she wants to choose. Perhaps the user want to search by the state that they live in, their favorite subject, resource type that is requested, or they want to donate to schools that have never received funding or schools that have a very high poverty level. Or perhaps the user loves to play the violin and wants to donate to projects that involve this instruments - they can search by keyword for 'violin' and see what results they get. The user can also enter multiple selection criteria. For instance, they can search for 'health and sports' (by subject)  while also searching for 'grades 3-5' (by grade level) in 'PA' (by state). Note that searching by state is not case sensitive. The top 10 results (if available) of classroom projects will be displayed. 

My hope is that this will encourage people to do a good deed and donate to public school in need of extra funds.
